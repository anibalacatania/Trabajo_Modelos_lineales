abstract = {The effect of microoxygenation on the composition of a red wine was investigated, where oxygen was applied at both low and high rates (5 and 20 mg/L/month) through a diffuser or via permeation through polyethylene tanks. A control with no oxygen was also included. Each treatment was performed in triplicate, using a commercially made Cabernet Sauvignon wine, in nine 300-L stainless-steel and three 300-L polyethylene tanks at 16{\{}degrees{\}}C over 16 weeks. Spontaneous malolactic fermentation occurred simultaneously with the microoxygenation treatments. The results indicated that microoxygenation enhanced the wine color development, in which effects on pigments resistant to SO2 were more marked in the first half of the trial and more obvious influences on color density were seen during the second half of the trial. Microoxygenation, as applied in this study, did not show any effect on the desirable varietal thiol 3-mercaptohexanol, yet led to some decreases in the concentrations of undesirable off-odors, including a lowering in the concentration of methanethiol without an increase in the concentration of dimethyl disulfide. Changes in the concentrations of other reductive sulfur compounds, except the thioesters, were also affected by oxygen and further by the influence of spontaneous malolactic fermentation, indicating the complicated interactions of these compounds in the wine matrix.},

abstract = {The nonenzymatic oxidation of wine has profound effects on its sensory attributes and, thus, perceived quality. While wine oxidation has been studied for centuries, only recently has the role of free radical intermediates in wine aging been seriously addressed. In this study, the effect of various wine components on the formation or suppression of free radicals was investigated. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spin trapping was used to detect, quantify, and identify factors that alter the major radical species formed in actual wine systems. In all cases and across all treatments, the 1-hydroxyethyl radical was the sole spin adduct detected, suggesting that the Fenton reaction (i.e., formation of the hydroxyl radical and its subsequent oxidation of ethanol) is the major route for oxidation in wine. The addition of either iron, copper, or iron and copper in combination to a red wine resulted in a marked increase in observed spin adducts, demonstrating that trace levels of metals are essential catalysts in the oxidation of wine. The addition of catechin to a white wine containing excess sulfur dioxide had no effect on the initial rate of radical formation, but was prooxidative in the latter stages of the experiment. Finally, sulfur dioxide was shown to inhibit radical formation in a concentration-dependent manner.},

abstract = {The influence of three levels of oxygen supply on the phenolic composition of Sangiovese wine was evaluated during 6 months of storage. Oxygenation reduced the total phenolics content and increased the concentration of red polymeric compounds. Saturation with oxygen every 30 days significantly improved the wine colour density as compared to the control. The individual behaviour of phenolic compounds such as (+) catechin, (-) epicatechin, quercetin, caffeic acid, and anthocyanins showed a significant depleting effect of oxygen on wine phenolic composition when wines were oxygenated every month. The supply of oxygen every 60 days limited the oxidation of low molecular weight phenolic compounds and slightly influenced the wine colour. This confirmed that oxygenation could improve the evolution of red wines during ageing, but its control is necessary to reduce detrimental effects upon single bioactive phenolic compounds.

abstract = {Micro-oxygenation (MOX) was applied to a red wine for 5 months following the end of alcoholic fermentation and then both a non-oxygenated control wine and the micro-oxygenated wine were matured in oak barrels or bottles. The concentration of anthocyanin and anthocyanin-derived compounds and the chromatic characteristics of the control and micro-oxygenated wines after the maturatio period were studied. Anthocyanin and anthocyanin-derived compounds composition were determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; and, together with monomeric anthocyanins, compounds including direct anthocyanin-flavanol adducts, ethyl-linked anthocyanin-flavanol compounds, and pyranoanthocyanins were identified. The results showed that the improvements in the chromatic characteristics obtained by applying the MOX technique to Monastrell wines were maintained after an aging period in bottle or barrel. The color intensity of wines increased during maturation in oak barrels, whereas the color of the bottled wines decreased, although MOX wines always showed higher color intensity than the respective control wines. Bottled wines also showed a higher increase in tint and a lower quantity of compounds resistant to SO2 discoloration than oak matured wines, indicating that the formation of these compounds is favored by the oxidative conditions in oak barrels.},

abstract = {Sensory characterization is one of the most powerful, sophisticated, and extensively applied tools in sensory science. Descriptive analysis with trained assessors has been traditionally used for sensory characterization. Due to the cost of time and money required for its application, several novel methodologies, which do not require training, have been recently developed and are gaining popularity as quick and reliable options for gathering sensory information. These methodologies enable the study of consumers' perceptions of the sensory characteristics of products. However, information on these techniques is scattered in scientific journal articles, which hinders their application and creates a need for a book to assemble the details of the latest advances.Novel Techniques in Sensory Characterization and Consumer Profiling provides a comprehensive overview of classical and novel methods for sensory characterization of food and nonfood products. The book presents the history behind descriptive analysis, describes the most common novel methodologies and detailed information for their implementation, and discusses examples of applications and case studies. It also includes an introduction to exploratory multivariate analysis, addressing the theory and application of some of the most useful multivariate statistical tools applied in the analysis of consumer profiling data sets.Most of the data analysis is implemented in the statistical free software R, making the book accessible to readers unfamiliar with complex statistical software.Chapters examine a range of techniques including the ideal profile method, just-about-right scales in consumer research, free choice profiling, flash profiling, and repertory grid methods. They cover emerging profiling methods, such as sorting, and projective mapping or Napping{\textregistered}. Other techniques less frequently used for sensory profiling are also considered: the application of open-ended questions for sensory characterization, polarized sensory positioning, and the consumer-friendly check-all-that-apply questions. In addition, dynamic sensory characterization methods, useful for studying temporal aspects of in-mouth sensory perception, are described. The final chapter provides a critical comparison of the methodologies discussed, their advantages and disadvantages, and general recommendations for their application.},

@article{Danilewicz2007a,
abstract = {The rate of oxidation of SO2 was studied in a wine-model system under aerial oxygen saturation conditions to gain further insight into its mechanism of action in wine. When SO2 was studied alone, no significant oxidation was observed unless iron and copper were introduced. When these metals were added a slow oxidation was observed and bound SO2 also increased to a small but significant extent. These results are consistent with a radical chain mechanism initiated by metal catalysis, in which powerful oxidizing radicals, capable of oxidizing ethanol to acetaldehyde, are produced. This increase in bound SO2 is prevented by 4-methylcatechol (4-MeC) in keeping with the known ability of polyphenols to scavenge these intermediate radicals and thus to inhibit SO2 autoxidation, which consequently should not occur in wine. When 4-MeC was introduced at a concentration that simulated the reducing capacity of red wine, again no significant SO2 oxidation was observed without addition of iron and copper. Had the catechol been oxidized, hydrogen peroxide would have been generated and reacted with the SO2. In the presence of both metals the rate of SO2 oxidation was markedly increased compared to SO2 alone and then was dependent on the concentration of the catechol. These results demonstrate the crucial importance of metals in allowing polyphenol oxidation and that the rate of SO2 consumption is dependent on the rate of catechol oxidation. When iron and copper were added separately, only a modest increase in rate of catechol oxidation resulted. However, when combined, marked synergism was observed and the rate then became very sensitive to copper concentration. It is proposed that copper, by interacting with oxygen, facilitates redox cycling of iron. Exposure of a red wine to the conditions used in this study produced similar results regarding SO2 oxidation to those observed.},

abstract = {The spectral characteristics and stability of three red wine pigments (pyranoMv-catechin, pyranoMvepicatechin, and pyranoMv-dimer B3) toward pH variation and bisulfite bleaching, as well as their color stability and degradation during storage, have been studied. Unlike the absorbance spectra of most wine pigments, the intensity of which is more increased in more acidic conditions, oligomeric pyranoMv-flavanols have maximum absorbance at wine pH around 3.6, up to 30-50{\%} higher than that in pH 1.0. This particular hyperchromic effect shown in mildly acidic solutions suggests the presence of intramolecular copigmentation in the molecule of pyranoanthocyanin-flavanols, giving rise to higher molar extinction coefficients around wine pH and contributing to the overall wine color.The most probable conformations were determined by computer-assisted model building and molecular mechanics. Besides exceptional stability toward pH variations, pyranoanthocyanin-flavanols were also shown to be entirely resistant to bleaching by sulfur dioxide. During a 6 month storageperiod, pyranoanthocyanin-flavanols were much more stable against degradation than the anthocyanin with the following order: pyranoMv-catechin {\textgreater} pyranoMv-dimer B3 {\textgreater} pyranoMv-epicatechin {\textgreater} carboxy-pyranoMv ≥ Mv. Kinetic decomposition monitored by high-performance liquid chromatographydiode array detection-mass spectrometry revealed the formation of a new pigment (pyranone-Mv structure) and the cleavage of the interflavanic linkage of procyanidin dimer in the solutions containingcarboxy-pyranoMv and pyranoMv-dimer B3, respectively. Despite some degree of decline of these oligomeric pyranoanthocyanins, their color intensity was surprisingly enhanced, and their color stability greatly improved throughout the entire storage period, thus contributing significantly as long-lived orange-red pigments to the maintenance of aged wine color. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Micro-oxygenation is a process that reduces the requirement for wooden barrels thus conferring considerable direct and indirect cost savings. To fully realise the commercial potential of micro-oxygenation, however, a better understanding is required of the entire process. Three discrete trials are presented in this paper. The first investigates the chemical and sensory transformations that occur in a wine undergoing micro-oxygenation at different oxygen dosage rates. Both the sensory and HPLC data suggest that an increase in dosage rate accelerates the development of the wine. It remains to be determined at what rate the wine begins to deteriorate. The second trial investigated the effect of sulphur dioxide on the tannin development as measured by colourmetric and thiolysis assays. The results indicate that sulphur dioxide effectively retards the condensation of tannins, presumably through the nucleophilic addition of the bisulphite ion on the flavanyl-4-carbocation of a hydrolysed flavanoid terminal unit. The timing of the sulphur addition is therefore critical while the wine is undergoing treatment. Moreover the results suggest that the effectiveness of any micro-oxygenation after the addition of sulphur-dioxide is questionable. Finally some modelling work is presented that allows a better understanding of the micro-oxygenation process, specifically the marked effects of yeast lees on the oxygen consumption kinetics of a wine and the relationship between bubble size and oxygenation efficiency.

abstract = {A new approach to red wine aging was examined that uses a current passed continuously through glassy carbon electrodes in a process of electrochemical microoxidation. A Cabernet Sauvignon wine in 300-L tanks was subject to treatments run in triplicate over 12 weeks at 16{\{}degrees{\}}C consisting of a control, oxygenation to 0.67 mg/L twice weekly (equivalent to 4 mL O2 per liter wine per month), and electrochemical oxidation of 6144 {\{}micro{\}}A using 250 x 6-mm glassy carbon rods. The potential at the electrode was observed to exceed 2 V, where both oxidation of wine polyphenols and direct oxidation of ethanol can occur. While there was considerable loss of bound SO2 in the oxygenated wines, the concentration of bound SO2 in the electrochemical microoxidation wines actually increased as the trial proceeded, consistent with the rise in acetaldehyde observed in these wines during the final weeks of the trial. There was little change in concentrations of individual polyphenols, although the rate of decline in monomeric anthocyanins and free quercetin was greater in the oxygenated and electrochemical microoxidated wines than in the controls. Spectrophotometric measures showed an increase in SO2-resistant pigments and a larger modified hue value (420/520 nm) in both oxygenated and electrochemical microoxidated wines. Electrochemical microoxidation provides an alternative technology for aging red wines with precise control of the rate of oxidation and treatment cut-off.},

abstract = {Oxygen has a fundamental role in the vinification process and occurs in the various stages, particularly during the fermentation and aging of wines. Phenolic compounds, such as oxygen, are relatively important in wine quality. Among polyphenols, anthocyanins and tannins are the most important compounds since they contribute to the organoleptic characteristics of wines, particularly colour and astringency. During wine-making and aging, phenolics extracted from grapes gradually change owing to biochemical reactions, which result in a decrease in astringency as well as colour stabilization. Therefore, addition of a measured amount of oxygen, referred to as a microoxygenation process, was proposed to improve wine quality by accelerating these transformations of phenols. In a microoxygenation process, it is assumed that modification of phenolic compound reactions by oxidation should result in more coloured and less astringent products. In this article, the role of oxygen, phenolics and microoxygenation application in wine technology has been reviewed. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2013 The Institute of Brewing {\&} Distilling},

abstract = {Phenolic compounds play a major role in red wine quality, affecting color, taste and mouth feel as well as aging potential. The objective of this research was to compare the phenolic composition of Malbec wines from California and Mendoza, Argentina, made in the 150L volumes. Sixteen vineyards in California and twenty-six blocks in Mendoza were selected based on their uniformity and regional representativeness. Anthocyanins and low molecular weight phenolics (LMWP) were analyzed by HPLC at approximately six to nine months of aging. These Malbec wines were discriminated using chemometrics on thirty three phenolic components comprising individual anthocyanins, low molecular weight phenolics and total phenolics by HPLC. These differences suggest that Malbec wines with different phenolic profiles are produced in Mendoza and California.},

The solutions were prepared both with and without ethanol. Quantification of glyoxylic acid and other oxidation products, including hydrogen peroxide and formic acid, were performed using ion exclusion chromatography. Glyoxylic acid was only detected in tartaric acid samples that had been stored outdoors and sunlight was identified as the critical component of outdoor storage that allowed its formation. The hydrogen peroxide and glyoxylic acid generated under these conditions were of limited stability due to their reaction with each other to produce formic acid. The concentration of the glyoxylic acid was greatly increased when ethanol was omitted from the sample matrix. Copper(II) enhanced the stability of glyoxylic acid but slowed its production. The reaction pathway responsible for the sunlight-induced production and subsequent stability of glyoxylic acid is discussed. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The effect of micro-oxygenation on the aromas of two varietal wines (Tempranillo and Cabernet Sauvignon) when alcoholic fermentation is complete was examined. Several factors, such as whether malolactic fermentation (MLF) took place in barrels or stainless steel vats and ageing time in oak barrels, were taken into account. Major aroma components were studied using GC-FID and minor compounds were studied by GC-MS analysis before and after MLF and after 4 and 8 months of maturation in oak barrels. Sensorial analysis was performed to describe and quantify the different wine notes. Micro-oxygenation affects different compounds but the effect depends to a great extent on the grape varietal used; the effect of micro-oxygenation was more marked on the aroma of Cabernet Sauvignon wine than Tempranillo wines. The concentration of extractable compounds of wood was higher in wines after MLF in barrels than in wines after MLF in steel vats; wines with steel vat MLF had fewer toast and wood notes. The compounds that showed significant differences in concentration after 8 months of maturation were present in higher concentrations in wines fermented in barrels than in stainless steel vats. Barrel-fermented wines were sweeter, with wood and toast notes, fewer alcohol notes and fewer reductive notes. ?? 2008 Swiss Society of Food Science and Technology.},

The level of monomeric phenolics and low molecular-weight phenolic oligomers decreased with age, while the level of high molecular-weight phenolics increased. On the other hand, total phenols given by the Folin-Ciocalteau method, antioxidant capacity determined using a controlled chain reaction of methyl linoleate and the intensity of the anodic peak determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) did not show any significant correlation with wine age. Total phenols and the shapes of CV traces were more dependent on the grape variety and the particular viticultural and wine-making practices rather than on wine age. At the same time, young and aged wines showed a pronounced difference in the shape of [O2] traces recorded during the oxidation of methyl linoleate in a micellar solution inhibited by wine addition. Possible reasons why the antioxidant activity of red wines does not correlate with wine age are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2006 Society of Chemical Industry.},

abstract = {By combining protein precipitation and traditional bisulfite bleaching to distinguish monomeric anthocyanins from polymeric pigments, two classes of polymeric pigments in grapes and wines were observed: small polymeric pigments (SPP) that do not precipitate with protein and large polymeric pigments (LPP) that do. The combined assay was used to study the polymeric pigment composition of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah berries during ripening and to compare the composition of the fruit at harvest with the wine made from that fruit. Although fruit of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah contained very little polymeric pigment compared to the corresponding wines, nearly all of the polymeric pigment found in fruit was SPP with very little LPP. The percentage of the color at pH 4.9 due to LPP was 7-fold higher in Syrah wines as compared to the corresponding fruit, whereas in Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinot noir the difference was greater than 2-fold. This suggests that most of the LPP found in wines is formed during winemaking. By contrast, the percentage of color due to SPP in wines compared to fruit was variable, decreasing in Syrah, increasing in Cabernet Sauvignon, with little change in Pinot noir. The combined protein precipitation/bisulfite bleaching analysis used in this study allows the parallel determination of tannins and polymeric pigments in grape extracts and wines.},

During bottled aging, the chemical and organoleptic composition of wines is subject to changes depending on the aging conditions (closure, oxygen level, temperature, time). However, the combined effect of these factors on chemical composition and organoleptic characteristics of Malbec wines has not been studied yet. Wines were bottled with screw cap and natural cork and were kept in chambers at 15 °C and 25 °C for 2 years. Sampling was performed at 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 months. Concentrations of free sulfur dioxide, dissolved oxygen, anthocyanins, tannins, esters, volatile phenols, organic acids, and color saturation decreased during the storage process. While, the formation of polymeric pigments, the color attributes (lightness and hue) and the levels of alcohols, norisoprenoids, furanoids and terpenoids increased. At 24 months, Malbec wines were organoleptically different. Wines kept at 15 °C were associated with high sensory perceptions in color intensity and violet tint, those presented a positive correlation with free sulfur dioxide, tannins, and anthocyanins levels. On the contrary, wines aged at 25 °C were linked with high sensory perceptions of dried vegetative and dried fruit aromas. These descriptors were positively correlated with norisoprenoids, furanoids, and terpenoids. In general, the chemical composition and organoleptic attributes of bottled Malbec wines (Mendoza, Argentina) were stable respect closure type employed, but highly sensitive to the combined effect of time and storage temperature. This finding is key to making decisions about the wine style searched, and costs (e.g. refrigeration) involved in the conservation period until consumption.},

The astringency was evaluated by sensory analysis and by a method based on the SDS-PAGE of salivary proteins after reaction of saliva with wine (SPI, saliva precipitation index). Micro-oxygenation caused a stabilization of color, but this effect disappeared after long aging. For the wine with the lower pH a decrease of wine astringency and SPI was observed 42 months after micro-oxygenation. Oxygen ingress through the closure postbottling was positively correlated with the decrease of SPI. Therefore, the astringency and reactivity of wines toward salivary proteins of a bottled red wine can be modulated by controlled oxygen exposure during aging. For both experiments the effect of oxygen exposure depended on wine composition.},

abstract = {The main dietary sources of polyphenols are reviewed, and the daily intake is calculated for a given diet containing some common fruits, vegetables and beverages. Phenolic acids account for about one third of the total intake and flavonoids account for the remaining two thirds. The most abundant flavonoids in the diet are flavanols (catechins plus proanthocyanidins), anthocyanins and their oxidation products. The main polyphenol dietary sources are fruit and beverages (fruit juice, wine, tea, coffee, chocolate and beer) and, to a lesser extent vegetables, dry legumes and cereals. The total intake is approximately 1 g/d. Large uncertainties remain due to the lack of comprehensive data on the content of some of the main polyphenol classes in food. Bioavailability studies in humans are discussed. The maximum concentration in plasma rarely exceeds 1 microM after the consumption of 10-100 mg of a single phenolic compound. However, the total plasma phenol concentration is probably higher due to the presence of metabolites formed in the body's tissues or by the colonic microflora. These metabolites are still largely unknown and not accounted for. Both chemical and biochemical factors that affect the absorption and metabolism of polyphenols are reviewed, with particular emphasis on flavonoid glycosides. A better understanding of these factors is essential to explain the large variations in bioavailability observed among polyphenols and among individuals.},

abstract = {Transition metal ions and Superoxide participate in different autoxidations to a variable extent. In the reaction of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) with oxygen at pH 7.0 or 8.0, addition of 5 to 300 U/ml Superoxide dismutase inhibited autoxidation by up to 96{\%} at the highest concentrations. Superoxide dismutase at concentrations of 5-20 U/ml inhibited by less than 40{\%} when present alone, but inhibited by over 99{\%} in the presence of desferrioxamine or histidine. EDTA also enhanced the inhibition by 20 U/ml Superoxide dismutase to 86{\%}, even though EDTA accelerated the autoxidation of 6-OHDA when present alone or with desferrioxamine. In contrast, other ligands, such as ADP or phytic acid, had little or no effect on inhibition by Superoxide dismutase. Proteins such as albumin, cytochrome oxidase, or denatured Superoxide dismutase also enhanced inhibition by active Superoxide dismutase from less than 40{\%} to over 90{\%}. Evidently, in the presence of redox active metals, autoxidation occurs by inner sphere electron transfer, presumably within a ternary 6-OHDA {\textperiodcentered} metal {\textperiodcentered} oxygen complex. This mechanism does not involve free O{\{}minus sign, dot below{\}}2 and is not inhibited by Superoxide dismutase. On the other hand, the presence of certain ligands (including proteins) diminishes the ability of trace metals to exchange electrons with 6-OHDA or oxygen by an inner sphere mechanism. These ligands render autoxidation dependent on propagation by O{\{}minus sign, dot below{\}}2 and therefore inhibitable by Superoxide dismutase. Previously conflicting reports that superoxide dismutase alone inhibits 6-OHDA autoxidation are thus explicable on the basis that at sufficient concentration the apoprotein coordinates trace metals in such a way to preclude inner sphere metal catalysis. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

abstract = {It was found that the reaction between malvidin 3-glucoside and added pyruvic acid (PA), leading to the formation of vitisin A in model wine solutions, was not prevented by the addition of either acetaldehyde (A) or several organic acids. The acylated forms of vitisin A. (3-acetylvitisin A and 3-p-coumarylvitisin A) were formed through the interaction of malvidin 3-acetylglucoside and malvidin 3-p-coumarylgIucoside. Disappearance of the three main anthocyanins (malvidin 3-glucoside, malvidin 3-acetylglucoside and malvidin 3-p-coumarylglucoside) from the model wine with time followed first order kinetics. Acetaldehyde had the effect of increasing the total amount of these losses but producing smaller amounts of vitisin A. During ageing model solutions developed some browness. The brownest solution was obtained without A and a reduced rate of browning was found in the presence of A. This latter result can be explained by the assumption of a superimposition of a blueing effect upon reactions of A with anthocyanins. In the presence of PA the formation of vitisin A compounds gave an intermediate colour, contributing a reddish hue to the solution. A good correlation (r(2) = 0.96) between the percentage of vitisin A, of the total anthocyanins and the hue angle was observed. The addition of large amounts of organic acids that are normally found in wine into the model solutions did not lead to the formation of new anthocyanins. The linear loss of PA in all model systems indicates that a first order reaction occurs and 35.35 times more PA than total anthocyanin was lost to form the new compounds.},

This study evaluated the sensory impact of extended maceration applied to Cabernet Sauvignon grapes sourced from a vineyard subjected to four RDI treatments: replenishment of 100{\%}, 70{\%}, and 25{\%} of full-vine crop evapotranspiration (ETc) from fruit set until veraison followed by 100{\%} ETc until harvest (labeled 100{\%} ETc, 70{\%} ETc, and 25{\%} ETc, respectively) and 25{\%} ETc from fruit set to veraison followed by 100{\%} ETc from veraison to harvest (labeled 25/100{\%} ETc). Each RDI treatment was replicated four times (n = 4) and made into wine, with two replicates designated as controls (10 day skin contact) and two as extended maceration (30 day skin contact). Wines were evaluated by descriptive analysis with a trained panel (n = 15) and chemical and sensory data were correlated using canonical correlation analysis. Wine-perceived saturation and purple component ratings were highest in 25{\%} ETc wines and were highly correlated with the concentration of flavonols, malvidin- and delphinidin-derivatives, and small polymeric pigments. Fruit-based aroma descriptors were highest in the 25/100{\%} ETc and 70{\%} ETc wines. Extended maceration increased perceived astringency and bitterness, which were in turn correlated with the concentration of flavan-3-ol and oligomeric proanthocyanidins. These results suggest that moderate RDI protocols such as 70{\%} ETc and 25/100{\%} ETc impact positively the fruity aroma component (black and red fruit), whereas extended maceration lowered fruity aromas, possibly due to the masking effect of the oxidized character perceived in these wines.},

abstract = {Analysis of protein precipitable wine tannins has become more commonplace due to the simplicity of the method and the strong association between tannin content and perception of astringency. The traditional protein precipitation method for wine measures tannins and polymeric pigments using 5{\%} w/v sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and the alkaline buffer triethanolamine (TEA) pH 9.4 to dissolve the tannin-protein precipitate and support the colorimetric reaction with ferric chloride. However, this method results in a high background absorbance presumably due to the alkaline pH of the resuspension buffer, which has been shown to oxidize phenolics. Experimentation with several buffer formulations showed that pairing TEA with urea instead of SDS allowed formulation of buffers at lower pH. Urea-TEA buffers at pH 7 and 8 showed significantly lower background absorbance and drift over time as well as a significantly greater amount of tannin recovered. These trends in tannin content and iron reactive phenolics were maintained across a wide range of diluted samples (100-1200 mg/L catechin equivalents). Using a TEA-urea buffer at pH 7 or 8 may improve on previous methods of protein tannin precipitation by increasing yield of tannins from the wine and decreasing the background absorbance and drift.},

abstract = {Cabernet Sauvignon wines with low and high levels of SO2 and glutathione (GSH) were treated with microoxygenation (MOx) in a 23 L pilot experiment. Treatment generally increased O2, aldehydes, and derived products while decreasing anthocyanins, vanillin reactive flavonoids, and SO2. During the treatment, when free SO2 was depleted in the low GSH wine, dissolved oxygen levels collapsed, with a concomitant increase of acetaldehyde, pyranoanthocyanins, polymeric pigments, and acetaldehyde acetals. This outcome indicates a possible acceleration of the Fenton oxidation of ethanol and other oxidation reactions by way of direct free radical reactions with oxygen. In wines containing high levels of GSH, anthocyanins were protected, revealing a protective effect for GSH for the first time. However, the protection was only partial, and while GSH may be effective in preventing the loss of volatile thiols, its use does not prevent color stabilization in red wines. Because both SO2 and GSH are able to modulate the reactions initiated by MOx, but have somewhat dissimilar reactions, it may be possible to manage oxidation outcomes by choosing one or the other during wine processing and aging. Because SO2 and O2 levels are related to large differences in MOx reaction rates, those levels are candidate indicators of the rate of MOx oxidation. Alternatively, the levels of acetaldehyde acetals may be useful indicators of the cumulative extent of oxidation under MOx conditions.},

abstract = {The anaerobic growth of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae normally requires the addition of molecular oxygen, which is used to synthesize sterols and unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs). A single oxygen pulse can stimulate enological fermentation, but the biochemical pathways involved in this phenomenon remain to be elucidated. We showed that the addition of oxygen (0.3 to 1.5 mg/g [dry mass] of yeast) to a lipid-depleted medium mainly resulted in the synthesis of the sterols and UFAs required for cell growth. However, the addition of oxygen during the stationary phase in a medium containing excess ergosterol and oleic acid increased the specific fermentation rate, increased cell viability, and shortened the fermentation period. Neither the respiratory chain nor de novo protein synthesis was required for these medium- and long-term effects. As de novo lipid synthesis may be involved in ethanol tolerance, we studied the effect of oxygen addition on sterol and UFA auxotrophs (erg1 and ole1 mutants, respectively). Both mutants exhibited normal anaerobic fermentation kinetics. However, only the ole1 mutant strain responded to the oxygen pulse during the stationary phase, suggesting that de novo sterol synthesis is required for the oxygen-induced increase of the specific fermentation rate. In conclusion, the sterol pathway appears to contribute significantly to the oxygen consumption capacities of cells under anaerobic conditions. Nevertheless, we demonstrated the existence of alternative oxygen consumption pathways that are neither linked to the respiratory chain nor linked to heme, sterol, or UFA synthesis. These pathways dissipate the oxygen added during the stationary phase, without affecting the fermentation kinetics.},

The implementation of a noninvasive, fluorescence-based measurement system allowed precise oxygen determination in red wine and in the gaseous headspace above the wine surface. Dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations increased up to 1 and 0.5 mg/L in the second half of pre-MLF and post-MLF MOX experiments, respectively. Untreated control wines showed maximum DO concentrations of only 0.1 mg/L at the end of the pre-MLF and post-MLF MOX trials. For both pre- and post-MLF MOX experiments, the measurement of DO was sufficiently sensitive to discriminate between untreated control and oxygenated wines. Furthermore, different levels of applied oxygen dosages could be differentiated using DO monitoring. Except for the end of post-MLF MOX treatments with high oxygen dosage, no DO gradients were observed within the tanks, suggesting appropriate oxygen distribution during the treatment periods. The novel concept to compare the rate of applied oxygen with DO lead to the expression of the oxygen consumption rate. Plotting this parameter together with the applied oxygen dosage allowed for the assessment of the balance between the ingress and the consumption of oxygen. During pre-MLF and post-MLF MOX treatments, the oxygen consumption rate was consistently {\{}+/-{\}}10{\%} of the applied oxygen dosage. However, wines receiving oxygen post-MLF reacted more sensitively to an elevated oxygen dosage than those treated pre-MLF.},

Cabernet Sauvignon wine is well known for its high concentration of tannin, making it an ideal red wine for aging. The impact of closure type after five years bottle aging has been investigated on a 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon red wine, treated with or without PVPP and micro-oxygenation (Mox). Two oxygen transfer rate (OTR) conditions (16 and 5 µg day(-1) ) into 375 mL bottles were obtained by using different synthetic stoppers.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Color was evaluated by UV-visible spectrophotometry, carbonyls by 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine derivatization, phenolics by HPLC, sulfur dioxide by the Aspiration method. Closure type strongly influenced color parameters involving SO2 bleaching, and some phenolics, particularly quercetin was affected, but there was little effect on carbonyls other than acetaldehyde. Polyvinylpolypyrrolidone treatment afforded the wines with the lowest levels of phenolics and color density, but highest acetaldehyde. Few effects of micro-oxygenation could be detected.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Closure OTR strongly affects sulfur dioxide levels, the primary antioxidant in wine, in aged wine, but phenolic levels substantially alter the secondary reactions of oxidative aging.},

abstract = {Wine micro-oxygenation (MOX) is the controlled addition of oxygen to wine in a manner designed to ensure that complete mass transfer of molecular oxygen from gaseous to dissolved state occurs. MOX was initially developed to improve the body, structure, and fruitfulness in red wines with high concentrations of tannins and anthocyanins, by replicating the ingress of oxygen thought to arise from barrel maturation, but without the need for putting all wine to barrel. This review describes the operational parameters essential for the effective performance of the micro-oxidation process as well as the chemical and microbiological outcomes. The methodologies for introducing oxygen into the wine, the rates of oxygen addition, and their relationship to oxygen solubility in the wine matrix are examined. The review focuses on the techniques used for monitoring the MOX process, including sensory assessment, physicochemical properties, and the critical balance of the rate of oxygen addition in relation to maintaining the sulfur dioxide concentration. The chemistry of oxygen reactivity with wine components, the changes in wine composition that occur as a consequence of MOX, and the potential for wine spoilage if proper monitoring is not adopted are examined. Gaps in existing knowledge are addressed focusing on the limitations associated with the transfer of concepts from research trials in small volume tanks to commercial practice, and the dearth of kinetic data for the various chemical and physical processes that are claimed to occur during MOX.},

abstract = {Techniques for micro-oxygenation of wines are now accepted practices in wine manufacturing. But, at present time, only wine tasting and empirical know-how are used to control the oxygen input. Our work aims at a better control of oxygen input in wine, where oxygen plays a role through its solubilization and its consumption by various substrates in the wine. This work aims at implementing concepts from conventional chemical engineering, i.e., mass transfer between two fluid phases, to rationalize, quantify and master the oxygen input during or just after vinification, in respect to the quantities demanded by the wine processing. In particular, the work presented here concerns the incidence of dissolved carbon dioxide in wine on oxygen transfer. This parameter must be considered when the micro-oxygenation is applied during or after alcoholic fermentation. This study shows that the presence of dissolved carbon dioxide affects strongly the efficiency of the transfer of oxygen to the liquid: it almost decreases one order of magnitude when carbon dioxide concentration changes from 0 to 1.4 g/L. For convenience and reproducibility, experiments were performed on synthetic solutions, but part of the results was validated on real wine. An explanation based on a simplified physical description is proposed. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Brettanomyces spoilage in wine is due to the production of metabolites, which together create the distinctive ‘Bretty' aroma and flavor profile associated with wine. The objective of this study was to assess the influence of three wine flavor matrices on consumer acceptance and the temporal sensory properties of wines containing high and low concentrations of Brettanomyces-metabolites. A commercial Shiraz red wine was altered through additions of whiskey lactone (oaky) and 2-isobutyl-3-methoxypyrazine (green). The Shiraz wines (unaltered, oak and green) were spiked with either low or high concentrations of 4-ethylphenol (4-EP), 4-ethylguaiacol (4-EG), and isovaleric acid (IA). All wines were evaluated by consumers (n = 105) using check-all-that-apply (CATA) for wine aroma. In-mouth flavor and mouthfeel perceptions were evaluated with temporal check-all-that-apply (TCATA) and a ranking evaluation where the top three most prominent attributes were reported. Lastly, consumers evaluated each sample on overall liking. Consumers were classified as having low, medium, or high wine knowledge level, in addition to wine industry experience. Differences in flavor and aroma attribute citation across all wine samples were described by consumers. In comparing oak and green treatments, the presence of whiskey lactone in the oak wine more strongly masked Brettanomyces associated aromas than did a 2-isobutyl-3-methoxypyrazine in the green wine. Brettanomyces metabolite-associated flavor terms commonly increased in citations by consumers when concentrations of 4-EP, 4-EG, and IA were increased from the low to high Brett levels (p {\textless} .05). At the high Brett treatments, citations of Band-Aid{\textregistered}, smoky, and leather flavor attributes were all significantly lower when oak was present. Consumers identified as having wine industry experience had lower liking ratings for the wine samples as compared to those without experience (p {\textless} .05). Results demonstrated the influence of wine composition on the perception of Brettanomyces metabolites, and provided valuable information to the wine industry as to how composition, or further wine style may influence the perception of wine spoilage aroma and flavors.},

The impact of oxygen on fermentative performance, as well as during maturation, has been the subject of extensive research, both during winery operations and in the final package. Recent studies have highlighted the impact of oxygen on wine chemistry during early parts of the winemaking process. This review will discuss the effect of oxygen introduction at various points, from harvest to completion of fermentation, of wine chemical composition.

The influence of adding different oxygen dosages before malolactic fermentation on the phenolic composition and colour stabilisation of wine made from Pinotage was studied, and the suitability of certain spectrophotometric and RP-HPLC analyses to determine these changes were assessed in tanks of commercial lengths. Total oxygen dosages of 0 mg/L, 16 mg/L and 32 mg/L were applied, after which the wines underwent malolactic fermentation and maturation in the same tanks for two additional months. Decreases in anthocyanin concentration showed a strong inversely proportional correlation with increasing polymeric pigment concentration. This suggests that the addition of oxygen contributed to the early stabilisation of wine colour in Pinotage red wine. Overall, tannin concentrations were not significantly influenced by the oxygen treatments, although lower levels were observed in wines treated with oxygen. An important finding of the study was that there appeared to be little difference in the colour and phenolic composition of the wines between the 16 mg/L and 32 mg/L oxygen treatments. Good correlations were found between certain spectrophotometric techniques and the RP-HPLC analysis used to study changes induced by micro-oxygenation (total anthocyanins, total phenols). The colour and phenolic composition of Pinotage wine can be influenced before malolactic fermentation by micro-oxygenation. Some spectrophotometric phenolic analyses showed the same tendencies as observed with RP-HPLC (anthocyanins, monomeric flavan-3-ols, tannins), indicating their suitability to follow phenolic and colour changes induced by micro-oxygenation in Pinotage red wine.},

abstract = {Different microoxygenation procedures before and after malolactic fermentation were applied to Pinot noir wines from two consecutive vintages using the same Pinot noir block and a standardized winemaking protocol. The effects of microoxygenation treatments were investigated by spectrophotometry, HPLC-DAD, and descriptive sensory analysis. Microoxygenation before malolactic fermentation was carried out in 250-l red wine fermentors at oxygen dosages of 20 and 100 mg/l/month for 20 days. Oxygen dosages of 1 and 5 mg/l/month were applied for three months after malolactic fermentation using 100-l stainless-steel tanks. CIELab results showed that microoxygenation in 2006 tended to yield light-colored wines with an increase in yellow tonality. Examining monomeric polyphenols after alcoholic fermentation, this oxygen-induced color loss may be related to the high flavan-3-ol to anthocyanin ratio in this vintage. Furthermore, twice the increase in acetaldehyde content upon microoxygenation after malolactic fermentation was observed in 2006, which indicated excess oxygen for these wines. By contrast, a low flavan-3-ol to anthocyanin ratio was determined after alcoholic fermentation in wines of vintage 2007. Predominantly, these wines showed an increase in blueness upon microoxygenation treatments. Low correlations among astringency related attributes proved that the chosen attributes independently characterized the sensory variation in tannic structure among the microoxygenated Pinot noir wines. Descriptive analysis revealed that microoxygenation predominantly diminished green tannins in 2006 wines. Dry tannins, although decreasing in course of microoxygenation with low oxygen doses, rose again at higher oxygen doses. Beneficial aroma changes in 2006 and the increase of color intensity in 2007 were more salient upon microoxygenation prior to malolactic fermentation. An unfavorable impact on Pinot noir aroma occurred primarily due to microoxygenation after malolactic fermentation. [Z 215] (Auth. abstract)},

abstract = {During alcoholic fermentation, even when Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells have used the required oxygen for lipid synthesis, they can consume much more oxygen with no detrimental effect on the fermentation process. Under these conditions, most of the superfluous oxygen is consumed by yeasts by the partial functioning of several nonrespiratory oxygen consumption pathways, which are characterized by the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). When excess oxygen is added to yeast cells, cell sterol content decreases, following the strong oxidation of intracellular sterols. During aging of fermented products in the presence of nonviable yeast lees (harvested at the end of alcoholic fermentation), the lees can consume oxygen for at least 3 years of the aging process. This oxygen consumption by yeast lees is related to moderate oxidation of yeast membrane lipids by the action of free radicals, strongly decreasing sterols in the yeast lees. The biochemical reactions involved in the oxygen consumption pathways during alcoholic fermentation may be the same as those responsible for oxygen consumption observed in yeast lees. Therefore, the cross-reactivity of complex plant polyphenols, tannins and yeast towards oxygen can easily occur during technological processes (alcoholic fermentation and wine aging). The micro-oxygenation of yeasts releases ROS during alcoholic fermentation and may favour the oxidation of wine phenolic compounds. As yeasts have much higher affinities for oxygen than plant polyphenols, viable yeast and yeast lees compete with phenolic compounds and then hinder the wine aging process. Also, the partial adsorption of plant polyphenols on yeast occurs during alcoholic fermentation, which modifies the overall reactivity of yeast and polyphenols towards oxygen. {\textcopyright} 2005 Swiss Society of Food Science and Technology.},

In this study, three red wines, made from Vitis vinifera var. Monastrell (2005 vintage) and with different phenolic characteristics, were micro-oxygenated to determine as to how this technique affected the formation of new pigments in the wines and their chromatic characteristics. The results indicated that the different wines were differently affected by micro-oxygenation. In general, the micro-oxygenated wines had a higher percentage of new anthocyanin-derived pigments, being that this formation is more favored in the wines with the highest total phenol content. These compounds, in turn, significantly increased the wine color intensity. The wine with the lowest phenolic content was less influenced by micro-oxygenation, and the observed evolution in the degree of polymerization of tannins suggested that it might have suffered overoxygenation.},

abstract = {Wine aging on yeast lees is a traditional enological practice used during the manufacture of wines. This technique has increased in popularity in recent years for the aging of red wines. Although wine polyphenols interact with yeast lees to a limited extent, such interactions have a large effect on the reactivity toward oxygen of wine polyphenolic compounds and yeast lees. Various domains of the yeast cell wall are protected by wine polyphenols from the action of extracellular hydrolytic enzymatic activities. Polysaccharides released during autolysis are thought to exert a significant effect on the sensory qualities of wine. We studied the chemical composition of polyphenolic compounds remaining in solution or adsorbed on yeast lees after various contact times during the simulation of wine aging. The analysis of the remnant polyphenols in the wine indicated that wine polyphenols adsorption on yeast lees follows biphasic kinetics. An initial and rapid fixation is followed by a slow, constant, and saturating fixation that reaches its maximum after about 1 week. Only very few monomeric phenolic compounds remained adsorbed on yeast lees, and no preferential adsorption of low or high polymeric size tannins occurred. The remnant condensed tannins in the wine contained fewer epigallocatechin units than the initial tannins, indicating that polar condensed tannins were preferentially adsorbed on yeast lees. Conversely, the efficiency of anthocyanin adsorption on yeast lees was unrelated to its polarity. Keywords: Wine aging; yeast; lees; polyphenols},

abstract = {We review the extraction into wine and evolution of major phenolic classes of sensory relevance. We present a historical background to highlight that previously established aspects of phenolic extraction and retention into red wine are still subjects of much research.We argue that management of the maceration length is one of the most determining factors in defining the proportion and chemical fate of phenolic compounds in wine. The extrac- tion of anthocyanins, flavonols, flavan-3-ols, and oligomeric and polymeric proanthocyanidins (PAs) is discussed in the context of their individual ex- traction patterns but also with regard to their interaction with other wine components. The same approach is followed to present the sensory impli- cations of phenolic and phenolic-derived compounds in wine. Overall, we conclude that the chemical diversity of phenolic compounds in grapes is fur- ther enhanced as soon as vacuolar and pulp components are released upon crushing, adding a variety of new sensory dimensions to the already present chemical diversity. Polymeric pigments formed by the covalent reaction of anthocyanin and PAs are good candidates to explain some of the observed sensory changes in the color, taste, and mouthfeel attributes of red wines during maceration and aging.},

abstract = {The influence of controlled oxygenation on the colour and phenolic composition of red wine was studied by UV-VIS spectrophotometry, liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to diode array detection (DAD) and electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry, and thiolysis. The comparison between the control and oxygenated wines demonstrated changes in colour characteristics along with a significant increase in concentrations of pyranoanthocyanins, ethyl-bridged compounds and derived pigments both with storage time and with oxidation. Principal component analysis was applied to wine analysis data measured throughout the conservation period. The effect of the storage time and oxygenation was clearly reflected in this analysis. Mass-spectrometric analysis of the wines demonstrated the presence of compounds which are markers of reactions involving acetaldehyde. Two types of mechanisms were observed. The first concerns acetaldehyde condensation reactions and the second, the cycloaddition process between anthocyanins and flavanols mediated by acetaldehyde, generating tannin-pyranoanthocyanins. The presence in wines of trimeric structures resulting from these mechanisms, as well as the results obtained after thiolysis of the fraction containing polymeric species obtained by Fractogel chromatography, confirm that proanthocyanidins react with acetaldehyde in the same way as flavanol monomers. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {During enological fermentations, superfluous oxygen consumption by yeast cells is observed. The superfluous oxygen consumed by the yeast cells is mainly related to the operation of non-respiratory oxygen consumption pathways resulting in an overall decrease in the total sterol fraction in yeast. On the other hand, yeast lees remaining at the end of alcoholic fermentations exhibit specific oxygen utilization rates ranging from 1 to 4 micromol O2 h- 10(-10) cells from the second to the thirteenth month of wine aging. This oxygen consumption capacity of yeast lees was independent of residual cell viability. In this study, we investigated the potential relationship between the oxygen added to commercial yeast strains during enological fermentation and the capacity of the corresponding yeast lees to interact with oxygen. Additions of low (7 mg l(-)) and excess (37 mg l(-1)) amounts of oxygen at the end of the cell growth phase were compared in terms of repercussions on the oxygen consumption activity of the corresponding yeast lees. As expected, the superfluous oxygen consumption by yeast cells during fermentation had a positive influence on the fermentation kinetics and increased cell biomass formation. Oxygen consumption rates and the total capacity of oxygen consumption by the corresponding yeast lees clearly decreased when oxygen was added during fermentation. This marked decrease in yeast lees reactivity towards oxygen was concomitantly related to an increase in ergosterol synthesis and to oxygen-dependent sterol degradation. Such degradation occurred when oxygen was added in excess. Therefore, oxygenation control during fermentation appears to be a potential way to optimize both the fermentation kinetics and control yeast lees reactivity towards oxygen. For practical applications, oxygenation control during alcoholic fermentation may be considered as a general tool for decreasing the highly reductive effect of yeast lees during wine aging.},

abstract = {The influence of micro-oxygenation (MOX) and maceration with oak chips treatments on wine was studied on wine samples from three vintages produced in the Yarra Valley, Australia. A full factorial design was employed where two factors (MOX and oak chips treatments) had two levels and one factor (vintage) had three levels. Three replicated treatments were run for each factor's setting. Wine samples were analysed using conventional laboratory methods with respect to the phenolic wine compounds and colour attributes since the phenolic fraction of wine is most affected by both MOX and oak maceration treatments. The same wine samples were measured with an electronic tongue based on potentiometric chemical sensors. The significance of treatments and vintage effects on wine phenolic compounds was assessed using ANOVA and ANOVA-Simultaneous Component Analysis (ASCA). Cross-validation was used for the ASCA sub-model optimisations and permutation test for evaluations of the significance of the factors. Main effects of vintage and maceration with oak chips were found to be significant for both physicochemical and the ET data. Main effect of MOX treatment was also found significant for the physicochemical parameters. The largest effect on the phenolic composition of wine was due to its vintage, which accounted for 70{\%} and 33{\%} of total variance in the physicochemical and ET data respectively. The ET was calibrated with respect to the total phenolic content, colour density and hue and chemical ages 1 and 2 and could predict these parameters of wine with good precision. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Carbonyl compounds are produced during fermentation and chemical oxidation during wine making and aging, and they are important to wine flavor and color stability. Since wine also contains these compounds as ??-hydroxysulfonates as a result of their reaction with sulfur dioxide, an alkaline pre-treatment requiring oxygen exclusion has been used to release these bound carbonyls for analysis. By modifying the method to hydrolyze the hydroxysulfonates with heating and acid in the presence of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH), the carbonyl compounds are simultaneously and quickly released and derivatized, resulting in a simpler and more rapid method. In addition, the method avoids air exclusion complications during hydrolysis by the addition of sulfur dioxide. The method was optimized for temperature, reaction time, and the concentrations of DNPH, sulfur dioxide and acid. The hydrazones were shown to be stable for 10 h, adequate time for chromatographic analysis by HPLC-DAD/MS. This method is demonstrated for 2-ketoglutaric acid, pyruvic acid, acetoin and acetaldehyde, wine carbonyls of very different reactivities, and it offers good specificity, high recovery and low limits of detection. This new rapid, simple method is demonstrated for the measurement of carbonyl compounds in a range of wines of different ages and grape varieties.},

No quinone product or oxygen consumption was detectable after 12 min under these conditions. Thus, if 6HODA is to react with molecular oxygen at a measurable rate, some other redox species is required as a coreductant. The subsequent addition of formate or mannitol proved capable of overcoming the total inhibition induced by the mixture of catalase, SOD, and DTPA. The simplest interpretation of the data is that most of the autoxidation of 6HODA, as commonly observed, involves successive reduction of a series of metal-bound species of oxygen; the actual transfer of electrons occurring within a ternary reductant-metal-oxygen transition state. {\textcopyright} 1984.},

Maximum oxygen consumption by wines made very alkaline was rapid, and reproducible values were obtained with a Warburg technique. These values were of the order of 200-600 cc O2/l for red table wines and 50-100 cc O2/l for white table wines. The oxygen consumption per unit phenol of wines or different purified phenol fractions under alkaline conditions was not constant, indicating differences related to the relative content of specific phenolic substances. All phenolic fractions tested did, however, absorb considerable oxygen, and white wines took up relatively more oxygen per unit phenol than did red wine.Studies of both enzymatic and non-enzymatic browning indicated that the catechin fraction was most important in browning. The catechin fraction's oxidation products appear to be capable of accounting for the color of most white wines, whether very light or a dark amber. An analytical technique using the vanillin versus Folin-Ciocalteu assays has also been proposed as a criterion of a wine's tendency to brown.},

abstract = {Originating in the grapes, anthocyanins and their derivatives are the crucial pigments responsible for the red wine color. During wine maturation and aging, the concentration of monomeric anthocyanins declines constantly, while numerous more complex and stable anthocyanin derived pigments are formed, mainly including pyranoanthocyanins, polymeric anthocyanins produced from condensation between anthocyanin and/or flavan-3-ols directly or mediated by aldehydes. Correspondingly, their structural modifications result in a characteristic variation of color, from purple-red color in young red wines to brick-red hue of the aged. Because of the extreme complexity of chemical compounds involved, many investigations have been made using model solutions of know composition rather than wine. Thus, there is a large amount of research still required to obtain an overall perspective of the anthocyanin composition and its change with time in red wines. Future findings may well greatly revise our current interpretation of the color in red wines. This paper summarizes the most recent advances in the studies of the anthocyanins derived pigments in red wines, as well as their color evolution.},

abstract = {A 6-month time series of chromatic character- istics and optically derived compositional descriptors was obtained for replicate full-scale commercial micro-oxygen- ated trials and control wines from two varieties, Vitis vinifera cv. Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. Two-week post-fermentation micro-oxygenation treatments resulted in a suite of optical properties and compositional descriptors significantly different from corresponding replicate non- micro-oxygenated control wines. After several months of barrel aging, both the Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon micro-oxygenated wines had increased color density (35{\%} and 7{\%}, respectively), higher color due to derivatives resistant to sulfur dioxide bleaching (40{\%} and 45{\%}, respectively), and higher wine age (10{\%} and 35{\%}, respectively) relative to the controls. Merlot wines de- creased in yellow tonality (3{\%}) due to treatment, whereas the Cabernet Sauvignon wines increased in both yellow (3{\%}) and blue tonality (6{\%}). Cabernet Sauvignon wines responded to micro-oxygenation about 10 to 30 days slower than their Merlot counterparts. Principal components analysis using the optical descriptors was successful in distinguishing micro-oxygenated from control wines within and between varieties and in following the time-course of wine aging for each treatment.},

This study has examined the effect of this technique on the volatile composition of two red single variety wines during two successive vintages. The microoxygenation treatment was applied at the end of alcoholic fermentation and before beginning malolactic fermentation. Once the microoxygenation treatment had finished, wines were aged in new American oak barrels for 12 months. The results obtained showed that the microoxygenation treatment did not cause significant changes in the varietal and fermentation volatile compounds, however microoxygenation slowed down the extraction of some of the volatile compounds extracted from wood. A varietal and vintage effect was also observed for some of the compounds studied.},

The oxidation products generated were analyzed as their hydrazones using LC-DAD/MS. Glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone were the main compounds identified, both of which were also observed in naturally aged and *OH-oxidized wines. As anticipated, the presence of ethanol in the model wine did not preclude the formation of these compounds. Additionally, when a young red wine was treated with these oxidation derivatives, a noteworthy increase in color was observed, most likely due to the formation of novel anthocyanin-based structures.},

Grapes from symptomatic red blotch diseased vines (RB (+)) mostly had lower concentration of total soluble solids (TSS) and higher titratable acidity (TA) levels when compared to grapes from healthy vines (RB (-)) at harvest. GRBD impacted grape phenolic composition by mostly decreasing anthocyanin and increasing flavonol and proanthocyanidin (PA) contents in berry skins. No major impacts were observed on seed phenolics. RB (+) grapes contained more amino and carboxylic acids, while RB (-) grapes contained more oligosaccharides, polyols, and some specific monosaccharides at harvest.

Although this technological step is thought to have a significant impact on the organoleptic composition of the final product, little is known about the interaction between oxygen and lees during such a process. During simulation of wine ageing on lees, we now show that some membrane lipids of yeast lees, in contact with dissolved oxygen, even at very low concentration, undergo a mild oxidation. These oxidation reactions lead to the production of lipid peroxides and then to the production of unknown end-products. They are primarily due to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and totally explain the capacity of yeast lees to consume oxygen during wine ageing. The lipid oxidations within the plasma membrane are responsible for strong modifications of plasma membrane order. Some of the final products of oxidation reactions may play a favourable role in the organoleptic equilibrium of wines aged on lees. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Nowadays, micro-oxygenation is a very important technique used in aging wines in order to improve their characteristics. The techniques of wine tank aging imply the use of small doses of oxygen and the addition of wood pieces of oak to the wine. Considering the low dissolved oxygen (DO) levels used by micro-oxygenation technique it is necessary to choose the appropriate measurement principle to apply the precise oxygen dosage in wine at any time, in order to assure its correct assimilation. This knowledge will allow the oenologist to control and run the wine aging correctly. This work is a thorough revision of DO measurement main technologies applied to oenology. It describes the strengths and weaknesses of each of them, and draws a comparison of their workings in wine measurement. Both, the traditional systems by electrochemical probes, and the newest photoluminescence-based probes have been used. These probes adapted to red wines ageing study are then compared. This paper also details the first results of the dissolved oxygen content evolution in red wines during a traditional and alternative tank aging. Samples have been treated by three different ageing systems: oak barrels, stainless-steel tanks with small oak wood pieces (chips) and with bigger oak pieces (staves) with low micro-oxygenation levels. French and American oak barrels manufactured by the same cooperage have been used.},

abstract = {The colouring material of a red wine was fractionated by medium pressure liquid chromatography (LC) on a C18 reversed-phase column. Three fractions were collected and studied by liquid chromatography-diode array detection-mass spectrometry (LC-DAD-MS) and spectrophotometry in order to evaluate their pigment composition and colour characteristics. Fraction 1 represented 31{\%} of the dry material (DM) of the wine and contained grape anthocyanins. Fraction 2 (61{\%} DM) also contained anthocyanins together with several vitisin-like pigments, which appeared as very minor peaks in the liquid chromatograms. Fraction 3 (8{\%} DM) exclusively showed anthocyanin-derived pigments. Diverse anthocyanin-derived pigments present in fractions 2 and 3 were identified by their mass spectra. It was shown that an erroneous notion about the components with influence on the colour of the wine is obtained if only the liquid chromatographic profiles are taken into account. At pH 4 the major contribution to the colour was made by the anthocyanin-derived pigments, which were hardly detected in the chromatograms, where the anthocyanins greatly predominated. An explanation is that the chromatograms are obtained in very acidic conditions at which the anthocyanins exist in the highly coloured flavylium form; however, at the usual pH value of the wine (3.2-4.0) they exist mainly as colourless hemiacetal structures. In contrast, the colour of the new pigments is much less affected by the pH and even if they may have lower molar absorptivity at 520nm at very acidic pH values, their colour expression at the pH of the wine is higher than that of the anthocyanins. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Its formation results from cyclisation between C-4 and the hydroxyl group at C-5 of the original flavylium moiety with the double bond of the enolic form of pyruvic acid, followed by dehydration and rearomatisation steps.

abstract = {Oxidation reactions involving phenolics might change the chemical and sensory profile of wines. While oxidation is a long-standing problem in winemaking, a definitive understanding of its chemical mechanisms is lacking, and such an understanding could allow us to better predict and control wine aging. We briefly summarize and discuss the current knowledge on the chemistry of wine phenolic oxidation and propose, along with other researchers, a new, comprehensive scheme in which the Fenton reaction and hydroxyl radicals have an essential role. This hypothesis suggests that catalytic iron converts wine's hydrogen peroxide into hydroxyl radical. This leads to a much stronger and less selective oxidant that could react with almost all wine components, in proportion to their concentration and with little selectivity for antioxidant properties. This reaction could produce many electrophilic oxidation products, mainly aldehydes and ketones, that could further modify the chemical composition and sensory perception of wine. While the brevity of this report precludes a full review of oxidation, our aim is to stimulate more study and debate on the mechanisms in wine oxidation chemistry.$\backslash$n},

abstract = {Micro-oxygenation is a new, innovative wine-making technique which involves the controlled introduction of low concentrations of oxygen during early wine maturation. It is claimed that micro-oxygenation can reproduce the benefits of barrel-aging but in a much shorter time and at a fraction of the cost. Micro-oxygenation is supposed to result in wines with soft, accessible tannins as well as greater colour stability which is obviously appealing to winemakers vying for a share of the increasingly competitive global market. The technique was originally developed in France but is now used throughout the world including South Africa. This report provides details on the practical application of micro-oxygenation. It also summarises the available literature on the basic science underlying the technique and reviews the scientific studies which have attempted to evaluate the impact of micro-oxygenation on wine quality, structure and flavour. Our current understanding of the basic science indicates that oxygen certainly does play a role in the phenolic reactions that relate to colour stabilisation and maturation. However, that in itself does not prove that the micro-oxygenation technique is consistently able to enhance the desired reactions. Scientific evaluations of current applications of micro-oxygenation have provided evidence that micro-oxygenation can increase colour and improve colour stability. Although micro-oxygenation does produce changes in tannin structure, the actual impact on astringency and mouthfeel are less certain. At present there is little support for the claim that micro-oxygenation enhances fruitiness or reduces green herbaceous flavours in wine. However, the potential risk of increases microbial spoilage associated with micro-oxygenation has also not been clearly proven. Wine anti-oxidant activity is of topical interest because of its importance in the potential health benefits of wine. Although it is possible that micro- oxygenation may decrease wine anti-oxidant capacity this aspect also requires further study.},
